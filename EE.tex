\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

    People have always wanted to exchange secret messages. From ancient times, methods such
    as the Caesar cipher --- which substitutes each letter in a message with the one a
    number of letters forward in the alphabet --- have been used to achieve that goal, and
    were the first steps in the study of cryptography. These methods have all had a shared
    characteristic: they needed their users to share a secret key.

    In modern cryptography, however, it is often necessary to exchange messages without
    having the chance of exchanging such a key; think encrypting a password entered into a
    website you are visiting for the first time. It is out of this necessity that the idea
    of public key cryptography was born. What this allowed was for two parties to exchange
    messages securely without ever having to exchange any secret information. Even if a
    third party were to listen in on all communications between them, they would still be
    unable to understand the messages they were exchanging.

    The main idea behind public key cryptography is that encryption and decryption don't
    have to use the exact same key: there can be a pair of keys, one used for encryption and
    the other for decryption. Say Alice wants to send a message to Bob and they each have an
    encryption key and a decryption key. Bob can publicly share his encryption key which
    Alice will then use to encrypt the message she wants to send, and send the encrypted
    message to Bob. When he receives it, he can use his decryption key to decrypt the
    message. Because of the way they are used, the encryption key is often called the
    \emph{public key} and the decryption key the \emph{private key}

    \end{figure}

    Even if someone were to incercept both communications, they would still have no access
    to the original message

    I have been interested in computers and programming from a very young age, and so I have
    recently made a few websites as personal projects. Since these websites required the
    users to create an account and provide a password, it was necessary that the
    communication between the user's computer and the server was encrypted. This, however,
    was handled automatically from the server using a public key encryption scheme called
    \emph{RSA}. All I had to do was generate a key pair and configure the server to use that
    key pair whenever the website was accessed.  Therefore, all the underlying mathematics
    of RSA encryption were hidden. Since this encryption scheme was such an important part
    of my personal projects as well as the entire internet, I became interested in how it
    works beneath the surface and how it can be rigorously proven that a scheme like this is
    "secure". This led to my research question: \textbf{How does RSA allow for secure and
    private communication over the internet?}

    In my essay I will focus on the mathematics behind RSA (consisting mainly of number
    theory), aiming to explore its proof of correctness. In the first section of my essay, I
    will introduce prime numbers, central to the area of number theory and to
    RSA specifically, as well as the concepts of linear congruences, which is what the proof
    of RSA is based on, and of residue systems and classes, which will help simplify some
    of the other proofs provided in the essay. In the second section, I will introduce a
    number of so-called primality tests, which are used in the generation of keys for RSA,
    including trial division, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and the Fermat test. In the third
    and final part of the essay I will answer my research question by providing a proof of
    correctness for RSA, and showing that it does, indeed, ensure that communication using
    it is secure.

\section{Divisibility}
    \subsection{Prime numbers}
    Prime numbers are one of the most fundamental concepts in number theory. A prime number
    is defined as an integer that can only be exactly divided by $1$ and itself.

    An interesting property of prime numbers is that there is an infinite number of them. 
    \begin{theorem}[Euclid's Theorem]
        The set of all prime numbers is infinite.
    \end{theorem}
%
    This was was shown by Euclid in his work \emph{Elements}, in a particularly elegant
    proof\autocite[19]{dence}:

    Suppose the number of primes is finite. Let us label them $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Then,
    consider the numbers $P = p_1\times p_2 ... \times p_n$ and $q = P + 1$. There are now
    two possible cases regarding $P$ and $q$:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item $q$ is prime and therefore there is a prime ($q$) that is not contained in the
            initial list, which supposedly contained all primes, or
        \item $q$ is not prime and there exists some prime $p$ which divides $q$. If $p$
            were in the list then it would also divide $P$. But that would mean that it
            would also divide the difference of $P$ and $q$, which is $P - q = P - (P + 1) =
            1$. But no prime divides $1$.  Therefore, $p$ does not divide $P$ and so is not
            in the original list.
    \end{enumerate}
    In both cases, there exists a prime number which is not contained in the original list.
    This means that it is not possible to create a (finite) list of all prime numbers since
    any such list will be incomplete.
        

    \subsection{Modular Arithmetic}
    An understanding of linear congruences and modular arithmetic is necessarry for the
    following proofs.

    Linear congruences have to do with division remainders. When two integers $a, b$ are
    congruent modulo a third integer $m$ they leave the same remainder when divided by $m$
    \autocite[278]{haese_ib_options}. Formally:
    %
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:congr_def_long}
        \begin{gathered}
            a \equiv b \pmod{m} \iff \\
            \exists\ l,m,r \in \mathbb{Z}: a = qm + r\ and\ b = lm + r
        \end{gathered}
    \end{equation}
    %

    So, for example, $4 \equiv 7 \pmod{3}$ since $4 \div 3 = 0$ with a remainder of $1$ and
    $7 \div 3 = 2$, again, with a remainder of $2$.

    An alternate definition is that
    \begin{equation*}
        a \equiv b \pmod{m} \iff m | a-b
    \end{equation*}

    These two definitions are equivalent. This can be shown starting from
    \eqref{eq:congr_def_long}
%
    \begin{equation*}
        \left. 
            \begin{aligned}
                a = qm + r\\ 
                b = lm + r
            \end{aligned}
        \right\}
        \text{Therefore, } (a - b) = (q-l)\times m :\: (q-l) \in \mathbb{Z}\quad
    \end{equation*}
    Which is equivalent to $m | (a-b)$

    When performing arithmetic inside a modulo, addition, subtraction, and multiplication
    behave exactly as one would expect. Namely, given
    $a\equiv b\pmod{m}$ and $c\equiv d\pmod{m}$:
    \begin{align*}
        a + c &\equiv b + d \pmod{m}\\
        a - c &\equiv b - d \pmod{m}\\
        ka 	  &\equiv kb \pmod{m} &&\text{For all } k \in \mathbb{Z}
    \end{align*}

    Division, however, must be treated using different rules. These will be referred to as
    the \emph{Cancellation Laws}\autocite[280]{haese_ib_options}:
    \begin{gather*}
        \text{Given } d = gcd(k, m)\\
        kx \equiv ky \pmod{m} \implies x \equiv y \pmod{\frac{m}{d}}
    \end{gather*}
    Note, that if $gcd(k, m) = 1$, i.e. if we are dividing by a number relatively prime to
    the modulo, this simplifies to:
    \begin{equation*}
        kx \equiv ky \pmod{m} \implies x \equiv y \pmod{m}
    \end{equation*}


\section{Primality tests}
RSA is based on using very large random primes as the basis of its encryption keys. It is
therefore necessary to have a method of finding such large primes. There is no known way of
directly generating random primes, and so the best way of doing so is generating
progressively larger numbers and checking whether they are prime. In order to achieve that,
a number of so called \emph{primality tests} have been devised

    \subsection{Trial division}

    This is perhaps the most intuitive of all the primality tests. It consists of simply of
    checking whether a number $p$ (the one being tested as prime) is divisible by all primes
    between 1 and $p$. This test however is grossly inefficient, due to the number of trial
    divisions that have to be performed for larger integers. There exists however one
    crucial theorem that provides an optimisation to this test
    \autocite[276]{haese_ib_options}:
    \begin{theorem} \label{th:prime_factors_less_than_root}
        All composites have a prime factor less than or equal to their square
        root. Formally:\\
        $$\forall \text{ composite } n \: \exists \text{ prime } p:p|n \: \& \: p \leq \sqrt{n}$$
    \end{theorem}
    %
    This means that is enough to check all primes less than $\sqrt{n}$ for whether they
    divide $n$, to ensure that $n$ is prime. 
    
    But why is that? Let us examine a composite number $n$

    Since $n$ is composite, $n=ab$ for some integers $a, b$ such that $1<a<n$ and $1<b<n$.\\
    Suppose $a>\sqrt{n}$ and $b>\sqrt{n}$. Then, $ab>n$ which implies that $n>n$. \\
    This is obviously false and so the assumption that both $a,b > \sqrt{n}$ is false as
    well.

    Therefore, $a \leq \sqrt{n}$ or $b \leq \sqrt{n}$. \\
    Suppose (without loss of generality) that $a \leq \sqrt{n}$.\\
    There exists prime $p: p|a$. (Note, that if $a$ is prime, $p = a$, but this does not
    affect the proof.)\\
    $p|a$ and $a|n \implies p|n$. But $p|a$, Therefore,  $p \leq a \leq \sqrt{n}$\\

    For example, to find the prime factors of 96, you would only have to test the primes
    between 2 and $\sqrt{96} \approx 9.8$, so the primes between 2 and 9. Trying
    each of these numbers gives the following:
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{96}{2} &= 48 &\frac{96}{5} &= 19.2 \\
        \frac{96}{3} &= 32 &\frac{96}{7} &\approx 13.7\\
    \end{align*}
    So, the prime factors of 96 are 2 and 3.

    Even with this optimization, trial division is still slow for very large numbers 

    \subsection{Sieve of Eratosthenes}

    This method allows for very quick computation of all primes up to a certain limit. Here
    is how it works \autocite{wikipedia_eratosthenes_animation}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write down all numbers up to the limit you have set.

            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{base}
        \item Starting with 2, mark all its multiples, and note 2 as a prime

            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{2}\\
        \item Repeat the same process, skipping any marked numbers, and marking
            as prime each unmarked number you encounter

            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{3}\\
            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{5}\\
            \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{7}\\

    \end{enumerate}

    This method is extremely effective in finding prime numbers, and can even be performed
    by hand for moderately small numbers. However, when applied to very large large limits,
    the method quickly presents a problem of the memory required. In order for the sieve to
    work all found composites must be stored, so that they can be skipped. The memory space
    required for the algorithm increases with the limit set, making it impractical for
    computing very large primes.

           
    \subsection{Fermat test}
    \label{sec:fermat}

        \subsubsection{Fermat's Little Theorem}
        Fermat's theorem (not to be confused with Fermat's \emph{last} theorem, its better known
        big brother) states that:
        \begin{theorem}[Fermat's Little Theorem]
            $p$ is prime and $p \not|\ a$ $\implies a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$
        \end{theorem}

        \begin{proof}
            Consider the numbers 0, 1a, 2a, ..., (p-1)a\\
            Suppose two of them $ka,\ la: 1\leq k < l \leq (p-1)$ are congruent modulo $p$, i.e.        %
            \begin{align*}
                      ka &\equiv la \pmod{p}\\
                \iff  k  &\equiv l  \pmod{p} &&\text{since p prime and $p \not| a$}
            \end{align*}
        %
            But the integers in $[0, (p-1)]$ form a complete residue system modulo $p$, and  $1
            \leq k<l \leq (p-1)$, meaning that $k \not\equiv l \pmod p$. \emph{Contradiction}.
            Therefore,
        %
            \begin{equation*}
                ka \not\equiv la \pmod{p}\qquad \forall\ k,l \in [0, (p-1)], k \not= k
            \end{equation*}
            %
            So, $0...(p-1)a$ are all incongruent to each other and so must be, in some order,
            congruent to the least residue system modulo $p$, i.e.  $0...(p-1)$
        %
            \begin{align*}
                a(2a)...(p-1)a &\equiv 1\times 2\times 3...\times (p-1) \pmod{p}\\
                a^{p-1}(p-1)!  &\equiv (p-1)!                           \pmod{p}\\
                a^{p-1}        &\equiv 1                                \pmod{p}
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}
        (Theorem and proof from \cite[109]{dence})

    \subsubsection{Fermat Test}
        Based on Fermat's theorem, a primality test can be devised.

        Given an even integer $n$ that we want to test for primality we can check whether
        $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ holds for a number of integers $1<a<n$.  This test cannot,
        by itself, prove the primality of a given number. It can, however, prove compositeness:
        if $a^{n-1} \not\equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ then $n$ is necessarily composite since Fermat's
        theorem holds for all primes. \cite{primality_akalin}

        For example, let us test the number 13 for with the Fermat test, using the bases 5 and 8
        (chosen randomly):
        \begin{align*}
            5^{13-1} = 244140625   \equiv 1 \pmod{13}\\
            8^{13-1} = 68719476736 \equiv 1 \pmod{13}
        \end{align*}
        So, 13 appears to be prime. Further testing with all the bases between 1 and 13 will
        confirm that 13 is definitely prime.

        Let's also test the Fermat test on a composite number, such as 15, using the base 6
        \begin{align*}
            6^{15-1} = 470184984576 \equiv 6 \pmod{15}
        \end{align*}

        There is, however, a set of integers called the \emph{Carmichael numbers}, which pass
        the Fermat test with any possible base, even though they are composite. Carmichael
        numbers are, indeed, rare, they are however infinite. \autocite[116]{dence}
    
    \subsection{The Euler totient function}
    This function is necessary for Euler's theorem and, subsequently, RSA encryption. The
    definition of the function is quite simple.
    \begin{definition}
        $\phi(\mathbf{n})$ is defined as the \emph{number} of integers $\mathbf{m}$ less than or
        equal to $\mathbf{n}$ for which $\gcd(m, n) = 1$
    \end{definition}
    So, for example, $\phi(10)$ is 4 since 
    \begin{align*}
        \gcd(1, 10) &= \mathbf{1} &\gcd(6, 10) &= 2\\
        \gcd(2, 10) &= 2          &\gcd(7, 10) &= \mathbf{1}\\
        \gcd(3, 10) &= \mathbf{1} &\gcd(8, 10) &= 2\\
        \gcd(4, 10) &= 2          &\gcd(9, 10) &= \mathbf{1}\\
        \gcd(5, 10) &= 5          &\gcd(10, 10) &= 10
    \end{align*}

    A quick conclusion that can be drawn is that, for prime $p$, $\phi(p) = p - 1$, since
    all integers less than or equal to $p$, aside $p$ itself, are relatively prime to $p$. A
    plot of the function in \autoref{fig:phi_graph} shows this clearly:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phi_10000}
        \caption{Graph of $\phi(n)$ for $n$ up to 10000}
        \label{fig:phi_graph}
    \end{figure}
    There is a clear upper bound on the function which follows the line $\phi(n) = n-1$

    \subsection{Euler's Theorem}
    \begin{theorem}[Fermat's Little Theorem]
        If $m>1$ and $\gcd(a, m) = 1$, then $a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m$
    \end{theorem}

\section{RSA encryption}
RSA \autocite{rsa} is currently, one of the most popular encryption systems in the world.  It
belongs to a category of encryption systems known as public-private key.  This means, that
it allows two users to exchange information securely, without having to exchange a shared
encryption key beforehand, as it would be required by classical encryption systems such as
Caesar or substitution ciphers. 

The system is based on the theory of congruences, and, specifically, on Euler's Theorem.

    \subsection{Definitions \& Terminology}
    Given here are some terms and definitions that will be used:
    %
    \begin{table}[H]
        \begin{tabular}{ | m{5em} | p{30em} | }
            \hline
            Term      & Definition\\
            \hline
            plaintext & The message that will be encrypted, in \emph{plain
                        text}, i.e. before it is encrypted. Usually represented as $M$\\
            \hline
            ciphertext & The message after it has been encrypted. This is what
                         is sent from one user to the other. Without
                         knowledge of the public and private key it is
                         impossible to recover the plaintext using just the
                         ciphertext. Usually represented as $C$\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    %

    \subsection{Encryption \& Decryption}
        \subsubsection{Keys}
        RSA requires a number of values that will be used for the encryption/decryption,
        known as keys.  The first of these are two primes \pmb{$p$},\pmb{$q$}. These are
        usually very large numbers, in the order of a few hundred or even thousand digits,
        but for these examples we will use much smaller primes, just for the sake of
        simplicity. Next we assign $\pmb{n}=p \times q$.  Finally, we need an integer
        \pmb{$e$} such that $gcd(e, \phi (n)) = 1$ and its multiplicative inverse modulo
        $\phi(n)$, i.e. an integer \pmb{$d$}, such that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$

        The pair $(e, n)$ forms the public or encryption key and the pair $(d, n)$ the private
        or decryption key.


        \subsubsection{Example}
        The values we will use for the example are: $p=13$, $q=11$, $n=143 \implies \phi (n) =
        120$, $e = 23$ and $d = 47$

        Let's begin with the encryption of a plaintext message. Firstly, the message must be
        encoded as a number. The simplest way of doing that would be by converting character
        into a number in the residue class modulo $n$ ---i.e. an integer between $0$ and
        $n-1$, inclusive--- and encrypting each character separately.  In real world
        applications, due to the complicated nature of the arbitrary messages that have to
        be transmitted, this encoding cannot be used, but it will suffice for this example.

        So, for example, the message "HELLO" would become $8\ 5\ 12\ 12\ 15$, using two digits
        for each character.

        Next, comes the actual encryption. With $C$ as the ciphertext and $M$ as the plaintext:
        \begin{equation*}
            C \equiv M^{e} \pmod{n}
        \end{equation*}

        Using the keys we defined, the ciphertext becomes $83\ 125\ 12\ 12\ 20$, which can then
        be safely transmitted, so that it can be decrypted.   

        When the ciphertext is received, the message can be recovered using the congruence
        \begin{equation*}
            M \equiv C^{d} \pmod{n}
        \end{equation*}

        Applying this to the ciphertext of our example, we get $8\ 5\ 12\ 12\ 15$, i.e. our
        original message

    
        \subsubsection{Proof}
        In order to demonstrate the validity of the encryption scheme it would be worth
        providing a formal proof. \autocite{so_rsa_proof}

        In order to show that we have to demonstrate that encrypting and decrypting a
        message gives back the original value. With $C$ as the ciphertext and $M$ as the
        plaintext, as well as $C \equiv M^e \pmod{n}$ for the encryption and $M \equiv C^d
        \pmod{n}$, what we have to show is that
        \begin{align*}
            C^d     &\equiv M \pmod{n}\ \iff \\
            (M^e)^d &\equiv M \pmod{n}\ \iff \\
            M^{ed}  &\equiv M \pmod{n}
        \end{align*}

        From how we have defined our keys we also have the following assumptions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $p,q\ \text{prime}$
            \item $n = p \cdot q$
            \item $gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$ 
            \item $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$
        \end{enumerate}

        There are two possible cases regarding $M$:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\gcd(M, n) = 1$
            \item $\gcd(M, n) \not= 1$
        \end{enumerate}

        In the first case, $M^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ by Euler's theorem. Also the
        assumption $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$ can be restated as $ed = 1 + k\phi(n)$, for
        some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. So, 
        \begin{align*}
            M^{ed} &\equiv M^{1 + k\phi(n)} \pmod{n} \\
                   &\equiv M \cdot (M^{\phi(n)})^k  \pmod{n} \\
                   &\equiv M \cdot 1^k \pmod{n} \\
                   &\equiv M \pmod{n}
        \end{align*}
        So the encryption scheme works in the first case

        In the second case, there are only two subcases, since $n = p \cdot q$ where $p, q$
        are both prime, and $ M \in \left[0, n-1\right]$
        \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{2\alph{enumi}.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\gcd(M, n) = p$
            \item $\gcd(M, n) = q$
        \end{enumerate}
        
        By the Chinese Remainder Theorem,
        \begin{equation*}
            \left.
                \begin{aligned}
                    M^{ed} &\equiv M \pmod{p}\\
                    M^{ed} &\equiv M \pmod{q}
                \end{aligned}
            \right\}
            M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod{pq} \iff M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod{n}
        \end{equation*}
        So, we simply have to show that $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod{q}$ --- since $p$ and $q$ are
        interchangeable --- to prove that $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod{n}$. This also means that
        the two subcases (2a, 2b) are equivalent. We will be using the subcase $gcd(M, n) =
        p$ for the proof.
        
        Since $\gcd(M, n) = p$; $\gcd(M, q) = 1$, and so, by Euler's Theorem,
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:M-q-euler} 
            M^{\phi(q)} \equiv 1 \pmod{q} 
        \end{equation}

        Also, since, by assumption $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$
        \begin{align*}
            ed - 1 &= h\phi(n) &&\text{for some } h \in \mathbb{Z}\\
            ed - 1 &= h(p-1)(q-1)
        \end{align*}

        Going back to the statement that we have to prove (i.e. $M^{ed} \equiv M \pmod{q}$):
        \begin{align*}
            M^{ed} &\equiv M^{ed - 1} M \pmod{q} \\
                   &\equiv M^{h(p-1)(q-1)} M \pmod{q} \\
                   &\equiv (M^{(q-1)})^{h(p-1)} M \pmod{q} \\
                   &\equiv (M^{\phi(q)})^{h(p-1)} M \pmod{q} &&\text{Since $q$ is prime,
                   meaning that $\phi(q) = q-1$} \\
                   &\equiv 1^{h(p-1)} M \pmod{q} &&\text{From (\ref{eq:M-q-euler})}\\
                   &\equiv M \pmod{q}
        \end{align*}
        As stated before, this is enough to prove the validity of the second case, and so of
        RSA as a whole.
    
    \subsection{Key generation}
    It is also worth looking into how the keys necessary for the encryption, as it is not a
    trivial process.

    The first necessary step is generating the two primes \pmb{$p$} and \pmb{$q$} that form
    the basis of the key. There are a number of processes for generating (pseudo-)random
    numbers which are outside the scope of this essay. In order to generate a random prime
    number, one would use such a technique to generate an odd random number and test it for
    primality.  If it is not prime increment by two and repeat until a prime number is
    found:
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, thick, main node/.style={rectangle, draw,
            minimum height=2cm, text width=4cm}]
            \node[main node] (generate) {Generate odd random number};
            \node[main node, below = of generate] (check) {Check for primality};
            \node[main node, right = 8cm of check] (increment) {Increment by 2};
            \node[main node, below = of check] (end) {Prime found};

            \draw (generate) -- (check);
            \draw (check.south) -- (end) node[midway, right=1pt] {Prime};
            \draw (check.east) -- (increment.west) node[midway, below=1pt] {Not prime};
            \draw (increment.north) edge[out=120, in=30] (check.north east);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{figure}

    At the core of this process lies the \emph{primality test}. Since they keys used for RSA
    are often 512 or even 1024 bit numbers (meaning they can take values of up to $2^{512} -
    1$ or $2^{1024} - 1$ respectively) using trivial primality tests such as trial division
    or even the Sieve of Eratosthenes would take far longer than would be deemed practical.
    For this reason, so-called probabilistic primality tests are used. These tests are much
    faster but sometimes provide false positives, meaning that they will classify composite
    numbers as prime. Examples of such tests include the Fermat, AKS, and Miller-Rabin
    tests. The simplest of these is the Fermat test --- which has been explained in
    \autoref{sec:fermat} --- 
    
    Then \pmb{$n$} is computed as the product of $p$ and $q$. $$n=p \cdot q$$
    
    Finally, \pmb{$k$} is chosen to be an odd random integer, relatively prime to $\phi(n)$,
    since $n=p \cdot q$ and $p,q$ prime, $\phi(n) = \phi(p \cdot q) = \phi(p) \cdot \phi(q)
    = (p-1) \cdot (q-1)$. So, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \gcd(k, (p-1) \cdot (q-1)) = 1
    \end{equation*}
